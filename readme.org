C++20 class for intervals and bounded types
* Types provided
In ~interval.hpp~
- ~Clusive~:
  Is it inclusive or exclusive?
- ~end<Poset>~:
  The endpoint of an interval in ~Poset~. Ends can either be inclusive or exclusive.
- ~interval<Poset>~
  An interval in ~Poset~. They are cannonicalized in construction so that all empty intervals have the same representation. This way, you can use ~interval~ as a non-type template argument!

In ~bounded.hpp~
 - ~bounded<std::three_way_comparable Poset, interval<Poset> bounds>~
    -  Constructing ~assert~ s this point is inside =bounds=.
    - ~a_bounded.get()~ returns the underlying data (and tells the compiler to assume we are inside the bounds).
    - Your binary operators work
